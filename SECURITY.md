# 代理工具安全使用政策
代理工具类似于VPN这种运行工作原理
使用工具前，请查看对应国家法律是否支持这种行为
如果不支持，可能会被认定违规或者违反法律的行为
因为有些国家对于VPN的管控可能比较严
中国肯定排第一，其次是俄罗斯开启了封闭式防火墙测试
就是不能用国外的网站遭遇封锁了
其他国家可能包括伊朗
我的建议就是你不要用在违法违规违法国家层面的法律就有很大的自身安全风险
可能会进监狱踩缝纫机
很多国家在这一层面的行为上面肯定没有明确的规定只是看你的发言，言论自由等内容进行收集
如果他一旦认定你违法了，就肯定会抓你

## 使用范围限制
我认为用于访问特定的网站也不太认定为违规
比如YouTube，谷歌,gpt AI 流媒体 比如奈飞 ,
对于服务端来说不能用cdn试图绕过进行长期使用 不然你可能会受到监管或者监控 用是可以用但是你要把控使用量不能太大 比如流量太大，会被提供商认定为你滥用或者异常行为
否则会被认定为你进行滥用，因为cdn厂商也能察觉的到的
比如最近cf cdn这一家已经增加了明显使用限制政策规
后续肯定进行管控

### 安全防范
虽然工具上提供了明确的隐藏IP匿名方式
那是需要你的vps或者是购买的服务来配合
但是你所用的注册用户名密码以及可能不安全，要通过别的方式检验密码的安全性，高一点复杂度就可能好一点
因为你虽然能使用工具，但是你也得担心自己的隐私保护
邮箱肯定是用你本地国家的服务，这个主要在于你的包括邮箱或者你购买那个服务的提供商是否会收集你的邮箱数据
或，使用工具时，他进行IP连接，也可能会收集到你本地IP到远程IP的日志
这一点你要么咨询客服问一下？要么就通过更高级的方式进行链式代理， 通过中转等方面，大概意思就是你虽然用你的服务器，但是你访问所在的IP不是你本身自己搭建的服务器，而是别的国家的IP大部分都是机房IP
是这种稳定性，不可能一直持续，毕竟有防火墙，规则限制，比如服务器本身防火墙规则或者国家层面
我的建议多去YouTube看看，小白也能学到大部分能懂的技术知识，虽然还是不懂，但是你能研究的懂一点点就行

# Proxy tool safe use policy
Proxy tools are similar to VPNs in operation and working principle
Before using the tool, please check whether the laws of the corresponding country support this behavior
If not, it may be considered illegal or illegal
Because some countries may have strict control over VPNs
China is definitely ranked first, followed by Russia, which has opened a closed firewall test
That is, you cannot use foreign websites and encounter blockages
Other countries may include Iran
My suggestion is that you should not use it to violate laws and regulations. Violating the laws at the national level will have a great risk to your own safety
You may go to jail and step on a sewing machine
Many countries definitely do not have clear regulations on this level of behavior. They just look at your speech, freedom of speech and other content to collect
If he determines that you have violated the law, he will definitely arrest you
## Scope of use restrictions
I think it is not considered illegal to use it to access specific websites
For example, YouTube, Google, gpt AI streaming media, such as Netflix,
For the server, you cannot use CDN to try to bypass long-term use, otherwise you may be regulated or monitored. You can use it, but you must control the usage. It should not be too large. For example, if the traffic is too large, it will be considered as abuse or abnormal behavior by the provider
Otherwise, it will be considered as abuse, because CDN manufacturers can also detect it
For example, recently CF  CDN has added obvious usage restriction policy regulations.
Subsequent control will definitely be carried out.
### Security precautions
Although the tool provides a clear way to hide IP anonymity, it requires your vps or purchased service to cooperate.
But the registered username and password you use may not be safe. You need to verify the security of the password in other ways. The higher the complexity, the better.
Because although you can use the tool, you also have to worry about your privacy protection.
The email must be used by your local country's service. This mainly depends on whether your email or the provider of the service you purchased will collect your email data.
Or, when using the tool, it connects to the IP and may also collect the log from your local IP to the remote IP.
You can either ask the customer service about this?  Or you can use a more advanced way to chain proxy, through transit, etc., which roughly means that although you use your server, the IP you access is not the server you built yourself, but the IP of other countries, most of which are computer room IPs. This kind of stability cannot be sustained forever, after all, there are firewalls and rules, such as the firewall rules of the server itself or at the national level. My suggestion is to watch more on YouTube, where even a novice can learn most of the technical knowledge that can be understood. Although you still don’t understand it, you can study it a little bit. You can also find tutorials through search engines
