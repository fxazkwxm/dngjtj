# 优先推荐使用第一个工具方便的一批。
现在我改变意见选择用hiddify-next ，主要是你用直连机场换IP很方便

代理工具推荐   只推荐安卓的代理工具，因为你没有使用苹果设备？
### 代理工具
1.NekoBox for Android 目前处于稳定期
连接测试网址请参考:  https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/discussions/62#discussion-2915369 
这里我自己推荐一个：
http://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com

如果被劫持了了用https协议，知道是都超时了，多连接测试还是无法使用，就用换那个https 正常使用代表就行了，还有一种可能呢，要么就是节点挂了，就类似于相当于网站被墙了

无敌好吧这个软件真的好用。

 2.冲浪板，更新挺频繁，就是不支持新协议。
:https://github.com/getsurfboard/surfboard/releases 你更新有什么用，不支持新协议。浪费大家的心情。迟迟不更新。虽然你是基本Surge 也不至于拖这么久，还不更新新协议？

3.clash meta  处于正常更新状态。
https://github.com/MetaCubeX/ClashMetaForAndroid/releases
某个人，他直接把这件事情闹大clash全系列的。工具都不更新。结果才得到惩罚了，被开盒 何必呢，没事做嘛，我都觉得那个人很惨嘞。真是赔了夫人又折兵

4.hiddify-next 
:https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-next/releases
海外用户开发的。功能简洁，但是更新挺好。不太喜欢。



PC端代理工具 :仔细研究，应该还挺简单，能用。我帮你们找下文档。对应下面那个不是上面那个。

# I recommend using the first batch of convenient tools first.
Now I have changed my opinion and choose to use hiddify-next, mainly because it is very convenient for you to change IP with direct airport connection

Small problem solving document:
https://github.com/fxazkwxm/dngjtj/wiki/Proxy tool FAQ
## dngjtj
Proxy tool recommendation Only recommend Android proxy tools, because you don’t use Apple devices?
 ### Proxy tools
1. NekoBox for Android is currently in a stable stage
Please refer to the connection test URL: https://github.com/XIU2/CloudflareSpeedTest/discussions/62#discussion-2915369
Here I recommend one:
http://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com

If it is hijacked and uses the https protocol, it knows that it has timed out, and the multi-connection test still cannot be used, just use the https to use the normal representative. There is another possibility, either the node is down, which is similar to the equivalent of the website being blocked

This software is really easy to use.

1.2 sing-box Chinese warehouse/Chinese translation

New proxy tool,

2. Surfboard, updates frequently, but does not support the new protocol.

:https://github.com/getsurfboard/surfboard/releases What's the point of updating, it does not support the new protocol. It wastes everyone's mood. It has not been updated for a long time. Although you are a basic Surge, you will not delay it for so long, and you still don't update the new protocol?

3. clash meta is in a normal update state.
 https://github.com/MetaCubeX/ClashMetaForAndroid/releases
Someone made a big fuss about this matter and affected the entire Clash series. He didn't update the tools. As a result, he was punished and his box was opened. Why bother? He had nothing to do. I feel sorry for that person. He really lost both the lady and the army.

4.hiddify-next
:https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-next/releases
Developed by overseas users. The functions are simple, but the updates are good. I don't like it very much.

PC proxy tool: After careful study, it should be quite simple and usable. I will help you find the document. It corresponds to the one below, not the one above.
